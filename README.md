Trajectories of molecular dynamics simulations for several realizations of grafted pores.
The trajectories show intrusion and extrusion events of water.

C8, C12 and C18 are the differen grafted molecules (from smallest to largest).
0.6 and 1.2 are the grafting densities.

A few comments on the duration of the gifs:
For C8 and C12, the events happen within a single pressure simulation, which represents a 10ns interval of simulation
For C18, both intrusion and extrusion happen throughout an interval of ~7.5 MPa, which represent a 60ns interval of simulation
