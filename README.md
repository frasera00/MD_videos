This repository contains trajectories of molecular dynamics simulations for several realizations of grafted pores.
The trajectories show water intrusion and extrusion events.

On the names of the videos: C8, C12 and C18 are the different grafted molecules (from smallest to largest), While 0.6,0.8,1.0,1.2 the grafting densities in gps/nm^2.

A few comments on the duration of the gifs:
  - For C8 and C12, the events happen within the time of a simulation at a single pressure, which represents a 10 ns interval.
  - For C18, both intrusion and extrusion happen throughout an interval of ~7.5 MPa, which represents a 60 ns interval.
  - For the ALL-ATOMS case, the intrusion event covers a window of ~20 MPa, which represents a 14 0ns interval.
